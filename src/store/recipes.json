        "Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with salt and pepper until combined.",
        "Heat a non-stick pan on low to medium heat and add butter or oil.",
        "Pour in the eggs and let them sit for 30–45 seconds to set the bottom.",
        "Gently swirl or stir the eggs from the edge toward the center.",
        "When halfway cooked, add optional fillings like cheese or vegetables.",
        "Fold the omelette in half and cook for another 30–45 seconds.",
        "Serve immediately while the inside is still slightly runny."

        "Use low heat to prevent overcooking and retain softness.",

        "Do not overbeat the eggs; mix just until combined.",
        "Remove from the pan slightly before it looks fully cooked – residual heat will finish the job."

        "Wash and soak raw rice, urad dal, fenugreek seeds, and poha separately for 4–6 hours.",
        "Grind them together with some water to make a smooth, pourable batter (like pancake batter).",
        "Add salt and mix well. Let it ferment overnight (8–10 hours) in a warm place until it rises and turns slightly bubbly.",
        "Heat a non-stick or cast-iron dosa tawa on medium heat. Sprinkle water to cool it slightly, then wipe dry.",
        "Pour a ladleful of batter in the center and quickly spread in a circular motion to form a thin round dosa.",
        "Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges.",
        "Cook until the bottom turns golden and edges lift up — ~2 minutes. (No need to flip if it's thin and crispy.)",
        "Fold and serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or potato masala."
      ],
      "tips": [
        "Use aged rice for crispier dosas.",
        "Poha helps give a nice golden color and softness.",
        "Fermentation depends on room temperature — keep the batter in a warm place or oven with the light on.",
        "Avoid using a freshly washed pan – seasoning is important for non-stick effect.",
        "Use a cut onion dipped in oil to wipe the pan – it enhances non-stickiness naturally.",
        "Always stir the batter before pouring to ensure uniform texture.",
        "Add water to adjust batter consistency if it thickens post-fermentation."
